My first attempt at personal webpage not reliant on CMS

In short this was just me playing with Canvas and JS. On initial load it drew a logo like this:
![logo_closed](/logo_closed.jpg)

You could then press the green buttons to turn the logo into this:
![logo_open](/logo_open.jpg)

It did not go any further than that, because I was not able to think of anything useful relying on such desing.
